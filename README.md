# 01-about-myself

ENG: A short introduction about myself.  
KOR: 저에 대한 짧은 자기소개입니다.

This is the first repository of my Github account.
I actually majored economics in college and have been planning to become a lawyer for my whole life. Fortunately, after witnessing AlphaGo and the price chart of Bitcoin, I have decided to take a sudden U-turn in my career to become a programmer intead.
I hope to be on Mars one day driving Tesla Roadster with Elon Musk.
Hope this repository is not both my first and the last repo of my Github account.
